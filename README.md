# ACTUAL Coding Test

This repository contains solutions to the ACTUAL coding test consisting of four questions, each demonstrating different programming concepts and techniques. Each question is organized into its own directory.


## Questions Overview

### Question 1: Mathematical Question
- **Description**: Determine the defect frequency target per user session for a class of 30 students, aiming for a 90% defect-free rate.

### Question 2: Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
- **Description**: Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. The implementation handles empty lists appropriately.

### Question 3: First Variation on Caesar Cipher
- **Description**: Implement a variation of the Caesar cipher where the shift increases with each character. The encoded message is then divided into five parts.
